I am an extremely motivated Physical Design Engineer with interests in the field of Digital IC Design and Computer Architecture. I am regularly trusted to deliver on the toughest designs because I enjoy finding new approaches and I do not give up!

Besides the cutting-edge technology and tools I work with every day, I believe the best thing is the people! I enjoy learning from experienced Engineers. My objective is simple, work with my team to deliver continued success, and to keep learning Physical Design!, and I have done projects in both FPGA and ASIC, details can be found in the project section of this page or on my [GitHub](https://github.com/abdelazeem201).

My area of interest lies in ASIC design, Timing analysis(STA), Physical Design, and Logic Synthesis

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently an FPGA Designer at [R&D Center "EAD Military"](http://www.mtc.edu.eg/mtcwebsite/ResearchCenter.aspx).

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ASIC Design "Verilog, VHDL, STA, PnR"

- ðŸ’¼ If you have questions, or you have a project I'm available to help and also I'm looking for a new opportunities, you can always contact me.
